<p>In this post, you will learn how to create a basic calculator in Vue.js. You will learn about the composition API,
    and how reactive elements of Vue.Js work. First, you will learn about the Vue.js framework, next you will learn how
    to install your first Vue.js application and last you will be guided in creating the calculator yourself.</p>

<!-- TODO heel verhaal over waarom Vue.js -->
<p>Most of front-end development is done using some sort of framework,
    whereas frameworks are bundles of JavaScript libraries that ease your life in building websites, web apps, or mobile
    apps. One of the most popular JavaScript framework is <a href="https://vuejs.org/"
                                                             rel="nofollow,noindex">Vue.js</a>.
    Vue.js is a Progressive Javascript Framework. The exact explanation of Progressive here is: <i> Vue.js is a
        Progressive Javascript Framework.</i>Learning a new framework can be overwhelming, that is why it can be useful
    to get familiar with a framework by building some easy applications first before you delve deeper in all the
    functionalities of the framework. One of those applications is a calculator. All functionalities of the calculator
    reside in the client-side of the application. This is why creating a calculator is a perfect example of a Vue.js
    Application. </p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Make sure you have the latest version of <code>npm</code> installed on your computer before you start installing the
    Vue.js application. Do so by running the following command on your Unix-based system.</p>
<pre>sudo apt install nodejs</pre>
<p>Now that we have the package manager installed to acquire JavaScript libraries, including <code>vue</code>, we can
    install our first <code>Vue.js</code> project. Do so by acquiring the latest version of <code>Vue.js</code></p>
<pre>npm create vue@latest</pre>
<p>Give your project a name. For this project, let's say we name our project: vue-js-calculator. For the next steps, you
    can choose <i>No</i> for all shown options. Now that the basic template is set, run the following commands to
    install all necessary packages and run the demo Vue.js project in developer mode.</p>
<pre>
    cd test
    npm install
    npm run dev
</pre>
<p>Wait for the installation to complete, if all went well you should see the following message:</p>
<pre>  <font color="#26A269"><b>VITE</b></font><font color="#26A269"> v5.0.11</font>  ready in <b>233</b> ms

  <font color="#26A269">-></font>  <b>Local</b>:   <font color="#2AA1B3">http://localhost:</font><font

</pre>
<p>Now you can visit the following page in your browser <a href="http://localhost:5173">http://localhost:5173</a>. You
    should be able to view the following content:</p>

<p>Congratulations! You now have your first Vue.js application up and running. Let's start with coding our calculator
    now!</p>
<h3>Creating the calulator</h3>
First, let's have a look at the starting point of any Vue.js application. The <code>main.js</code> file:
<pre>
    import './assets/main.css'

    import { createApp } from 'vue'
    import App from './App.vue'

    createApp(App).mount('#app')

</pre>
<p>This file file is included in the <code>index.html</code> file. The above lines load the App application from the
    <code>App.vue</code> file. Then the Vue.js application is bound to the div with the <code>app</code> identifier.
    Thus, the Vue.js application starting point is the <code>App.vue</code> file.</p>
<p>The current <code>App.vue</code> file contains all code to run the application. Let's remove all lines and make sure
    it looks like this:</p>
